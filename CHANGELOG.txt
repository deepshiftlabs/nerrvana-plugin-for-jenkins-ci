What's new in version 1.02.00 - 2012-10-12
 
 * Project documentation (generated with 'mvn site')

 * Multiple plugins support. Each plugin now saves test run results into the 
   file 'results.xml'. Last plugin in Nerrvana plugins chain can be assigned to 
   interpret execution results and create aggregated execution report. 

 * Misc changes and code improvements.

What's new in version 1.01.00 - 2012-07-23

 * Changed the way Nerrvana test run name is generated.
   Previously it was expected that Jenkins build folder contain file 
   'revision.txt' with last revision number.
   Now plugin doesn't rely upon this (because it is possible, that Jenkins 
   job doesn't use SCM at all)

 * Added hook for Nerrvana test run description generator: if Nerrvana plugin 
   settings XML contains non-empty tag 
   <test-run-descr-file>{filename}</test-run-descr-file>, 
   the content of this file is appended to the test run
   description. Actually this is more flexible way to pass version control 
   revision number, name of the committer, 
   or any other arbitrary information to Nerrvana cloud.
